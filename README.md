# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Prediction-ML-project
+	Performed exploratory data analysis on patient records and engineered features for higher efficiency of model.
+	Trained machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Tree Based Classifiers, Ensemble Methods.
+	Evaluated model performance of classification (accuracy and AUC) via k-fold cross-validation technique.
+	Applied grid search for hyperparameter tuning to find optimal combination of parameters.
+	Optimized the model to achieve performance of accuracy = 99% and AUC = 1.
